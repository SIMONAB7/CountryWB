Do this above! ^^^

Then do this in your command prompt:
```$ git clone git@github.com:MinesJA/github_guide.git```
```$ cd github_guide/```
If the $ symbol doesn't work try without it.

To create a new branch which you should always be working on (i.e., never work on the main branch as it should be the stable version of the website) use this command to create a new branch :``` $ git co -b create_user``` (if the co doesn't work try ```checkout``` instead)


To verify that you are now in the new branch you created use the $ git branc command.
It should show something like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78967292/223258697-77fff153-2364-41d7-a5fa-e0bb64ed1e77.png)

To commit a change use this command: ``` $ git commit -m "Added function to allow Users to say 'Hello World'" ```

Ones you are done with something use ``` $ git push``` to push the branch you were working on to GitHub. 

You should repeat all steps again if you want to work on the project.

ALWAYS CREATE A NEW BRANCH AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ON IT WHEN CODING TO AVOID ISSUES IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!
