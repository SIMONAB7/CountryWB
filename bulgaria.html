                    Prohodna Cave is a popular tourist spot in Bulgaria, known for its breathtaking views of ethereal light shining through 
                    symmetrical holes on the cave ceiling. Its name means "Passage Cave" due to the presence of two entrances at opposite ends. 
                    It is the most well-known cave in Bulgaria and features two naturally formed symmetrical holes on the ceiling that resemble 
                    a pair of eyes, which sometimes appear to be shedding tears as water trickles down them.

                    Prohodna Cave is nicknamed 'The Eyes of God' due to the light that shines through its two symmetrical holes, resembling a pair 
                    of glowing eyes that can be seen from either entrance. However, it is also known as the 'Eyes of the Devil'. This stunning view 
                    has been featured in the local film Time of Violence. The cave has a rich history, having been inhabited by prehistoric civilizations. 
                    It is unclear if the cave was used as a dwelling or for ancient rituals, and further research is needed to understand its significance.

                    Tsarevets is a fortress situated on a hill called Tsarevets in the northern Bulgarian city of Veliko Tarnovo.
                    It was a prominent stronghold during the Second Bulgarian Empire from 1185 to 1393, and was used as the main 
                    fortress and defense against enemies. The hill is 206 meters above sea level and contains the royal and patriarchal 
                    palaces, making it an important cultural and historical landmark in Bulgaria. Today, Tsarevets is a well-known tourist destination.

                    Tsarevets has three entryways, with the primary one situated on the eastern side of the hill. The fortress is positioned in the middle 
                    of the hill, enclosed by an inner stone wall, two defensive towers, and two entry points to the north and south. The castle features several 
                    essential areas such as a throne room, a castle church, and the king's quarters. In 1930, the restoration of the Tsarevets fortress began and 
                    lasted until 1981, which marked the 1300th anniversary of the establishment of the Bulgarian state.
